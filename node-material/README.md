What I did in this assignment:

Part I, \node-material

1. fixed a few bugs from assignment 3, incuding typo which stopped sliding bar menu from working
2. moved datepicker init from js script in index.html to jQuery in env.js file
3. added modal form to index.html for data entry - to create dynamic cards with new projects
4. implemented code to commit projects to MongoDB

Part II, \SocketTest

1. did someexperimenting with socket.io with view to implement chat using local server
2. first window which plays back user input and supporting server side are ready

What is not working:

1. Modal closes without refreshing the index.html, I haven't found the reason yet
2. datepicker is supposed to become one of the data entry elements for projects - and projects'structure needs to be modified accordingly - still working on it.

Kind Regards,
Julia

Readme BY Julia Axelrod, replacing Readme by Dr. Alessio Bonti

What I did in this assignment:

Used boilerplate code and styles.css provided by Dr. Alessio Bonti to begin the project

Project is located in node-material folder and includes
server.js and public folder, containing env.js, index.html and styles.css as well as folder assets with images, wireframe design document and homepage HTML.

What I changed and implemented:
Changed visual representation of index.html
Added my images from Antarctica
Chaged code:

in Server.js I changed port for internal reasons

- added global variable for future login
- added setTimeout to produce socket.id in socket.emit
- changed /test to output different message depending on user accessing it before or after setTimeout

In env.js I added

- append all projects to project list
- function to output allprojects on cards - for HTML
- added jQuery for sidenav intitialisation.

In future, I will add jQuery to initialise datePicker in this file

Index.html was modified visually to suit presentation of Antarctica views, but reference to Dr. Alessio Bonti was kept.

- datePicker was added to link to future projects for logging of expedition events
- menu was added with link to my homepage "Antarctica"
- div for project list was added
- datePicker was initialised using <script></script>, but in future will be moved to env.js to be initalised in jQuery

In styles .test-div div style was added for presentation of 20 projects in table

- Upload to gitHub was very chaotic, as I was unsure how to add a folder, I may need to re-do the upload.
- Added wireframe design file Wireframe for Antarctica website project SIT725 Prac 3.pdf

Kind Regards,
Julia
